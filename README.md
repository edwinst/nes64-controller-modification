# Modifying a NES64 controller with a 3-way switch

## What this is about

TL;DR: Modify the NES64 controller to have 3 options (UP, A, UP or A) for the "up" direction.

The [NES64](https://nes64.pryds.eu/) PCB is a great project
for modifying Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) controllers for use
with retro computers like the Commodore 64.

I find that these controllers make games, in particularly platformers, much
more enjoyable to play. The NES64 in the version I bought has a little 2-way
switch (located in its "shoulder") that defines whether the "up"-signal to the
computer is generated by pressing the "UP" direction on the D-pad or by
pressing the "A" button. The latter setting is great for games like "The Great
Giana Sisters" and other platformers as it gives you a much more natural way to
jump in the game by pressing the "A" button.

There are games like "Sam's Journey", however, where I like to use "A" to jump
but still use "UP" on the map and in menus. I therefore came up with a modification
to the NES64 that replaces the 2-way switch by a 3-way switch, extending the
options for the "up"-direction to:

1. only "UP" works
1. both "UP" and "A" work
1. only "A" works

## What you need

* the NES64 (PCB + the controller housing, pads, and cable)
* a 3-way switch with 2 parallel ON-ON-ON contact configurations (see below for details)
* a few inches of low-voltage wire
* tool for cutting PCBs (Dremel with cutoff disk works well)
* small tool for polishing (e.g. Dremel) or a piece of fine sand paper
* soldering iron + accessories
* a hot glue gun or some epoxy
* screwdriver to open the NES64
* ruler and marking pen

## How to do it

1. open the NES64 and take out the PCB
1. mark the cutout on the PCB
1. cut the PCB
1. remove the coating from two traces of the PCB
1. tin the exposed traces
1. solder the connections for the 3-way switch
1. apply isolation as needed
1. make the cutout for the 3-way switch in the enclosure
1. test assembly
1. apply hot glue or epoxy to mechanically stabilize the switch
1. final assembly, enjoyment (XXX make sure the cable is properly positioned)
